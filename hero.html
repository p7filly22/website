<p> My Dad was raised in the Bay Area until he was a high school freshman and moved to North Carolina. There he attended college at UNC and medical school. Soon after, he met my mom back in California and had me and my two little sisters. He currently is a radiologist but he has many other hobbies beyond that. He is an excellent coach for elementary soccer, basketball, and volleyball, and in he frequently plays golf... (hence the background)</p>
<p> He is my hero because of his dedication and leadership. He leads by example. He always goes the extra mile, and I deeply appreciate all the effort he gives to support our family. He has taught me countless skills for life, school, sports, and beyond. He is a very hard worker, and I strive to have his determination and passion for life. He is a hilarous loving father that many many people look up to. </p>
